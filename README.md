# DegreeOfArray
Return the length of the shortest subArray of the most common value of the array

```
degreeOfArray([1,2,2,3,1])  ->  2  //subArray [2,2]
```
Most commone values: 1,2

[2,2] is the shortest subArray of the most common value of the array. It is shorter than [1,2,2,3,1] which is the other subArray for the most common value 1.
The 2<5 so we return 2/
